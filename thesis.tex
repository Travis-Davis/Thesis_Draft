\abstract{A method to investigate the mechanical characteristics of geophysical scale sea ice floes is to be developed.  Sea ice will be modeled as an elastic-plastic peridynamical solid subject to external forcing by a virtual test apparatus and buoyancy.  The model is developed using Sandia National Laboratoryâ€™s LAMMPS software suite.  LAMMPS is uniquely suited to fine scale simulation of the pair-wise interactions integral to peridynamic theory, is open source, and is to be integrated into the DEMSI project.  Post processing visualization and data analysis tools have been developed in parallel to the main project.  To validate the model as an accurate representation of sea ice, the well documented feature of sea ice, the scale invariance of sea ice deformation distribution, is sought.  Furthermore, potential application of the technique in developing parameterization for sea ice models as a method to bypass impractical field experimentation is investigated.

% CHAPTERS
% You have two options on how to structure your thesis:
% a) A single file. All chapters, sections, etc. go in this file.
%    This can make navigating your thesis a little more difficult.
% b) Use multiple files.  One chapter per file is recommended.
%    This breaks your thesis up into logical units to edit.

% APPENDICES
% You have two recommended options for your appendix:
% a) A single appendix (with a single TOC entry)
% b) Multiple appendices. Look under the examples directory for a demo of
