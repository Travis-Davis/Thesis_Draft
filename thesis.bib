abstract = {Although substantial progress has been made in recent years in research on sheared granular matter, relatively few studies concentrate on the behavior of materials with very strong polydispersity. In this paper, shear deformation of a two-dimensional granular material composed of frictional disk-shaped grains with power-law size distribution is analyzed numerically with a finite-difference model. The analysis of the results concentrates on those aspects of the behavior of the modeled system that are related to its polydispersity. It is demonstrated that many important global material properties are dependent on the behavior of the largest grains from the tail of the size distribution. In particular, they are responsible for global correlation of velocity anomalies emerging at the jamming transition. They also build a skeleton of the global contact and force networks in shear-jammed systems, leading to the very open, ``sparse'' structure of those networks, consisting of only 35{\%} of all grains. The details of the model are formulated so that it represents fragmented sea ice moving on a two-dimensional sea surface; however, the results are relevant for other types of strongly polydisperse granular materials, as well.},

abstract = {Sea ice is a major component of polar environments, especially in the Arctic where it covers the entire Arctic Ocean throughout most of the year. However, in the context of climate change, the Arctic sea ice cover has been declining significantly over the last decades, either in terms of its concentration or thickness. The sea ice cover evolution and climate change are strongly coupled through the albedo positive feedback, thus possibly explaining the Arctic amplification of climate warming. In addition to thermodynamics, sea ice kinematics (drift, deformation) appears as an essential factor in the evolution of the ice cover through a reduction of the average ice age (and consequently of the cover's thickness), or ice export out of the Arctic. This is a first motivation for a better understanding of the kinematical and mechanical processes of sea ice. A more upstream, theoretical motivation is a better understanding of the brittle deformation of geophysical objects across a wide range of scales. Indeed, owing to its very strong kinematics, compared e.g. to the Earth's crust, an unrivaled kinematical data set is available for sea ice from in situ (e.g. drifting buoys) or satellite observations. Here, we review the recent advances in the understanding of sea ice drift, deformation and fracturing obtained from these data. We focus particularly on the scaling properties in time and scale that characterize these processes, and we emphasize the analogies that can be drawn from the deformation of the Earth's crust. These scaling properties, which are the signature of long-range elastic interactions within the cover, constrain future developments in the modeling of sea ice mechanics. We also show that kinematical and rheological variables such as average velocity, average strain-rate or strength have significantly changed over the last decades, accompanying and actually accelerating the Arctic sea ice decline.},

The strength of the ice is determined by its thickness distribution and therefore varies because of both thermal and mechanical effects. To examine the behavior of the model, several artificial calculations were made by specifying the strain rate history of a single element of pack ice and solving for the ice thickness distribution and the states of stress in the ice.

abstract = {Changes in Arctic sea ice volume affect regional heat and freshwater budgets and patterns of atmospheric circulation at lower latitudes. Despite a well-documented decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent by about 40{\%} since the late 1970s, it has been difficult to quantify trends in sea ice volume because detailed thickness observations have been lacking. Here we present an assessment of the changes in Northern Hemisphere sea ice thickness and volume using five years of CryoSat-2 measurements. Between autumn 2010 and 2012, there was a 14{\%} reduction in Arctic sea ice volume, in keeping with the long-term decline in extent. However, we observe 33{\%} and 25{\%} more ice in autumn 2013 and 2014, respectively, relative to the 2010-2012 seasonal mean, which offset earlier losses. This increase was caused by the retention of thick sea ice northwest of Greenland during 2013 which, in turn, was associated with a 5{\%} drop in the number of days on which melting occurred[mdash]conditions more typical of the late 1990s. In contrast, springtime Arctic sea ice volume has remained stable. The sharp increase in sea ice volume after just one cool summer suggests that Arctic sea ice may be more resilient than has been previously considered.},

abstract = {The effects of rapid Arctic warming and ice loss on weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere is a topic of active research, lively scientific debate and high societal impact. The emergence of Arctic amplification-the enhanced sensitivity of high-latitude temperature to global warming-in only the last 10-20 years presents a challenge to identifying statistically robust atmospheric responses using observations. Several recent studies have proposed and demonstrated new mechanisms by which the changing Arctic may be affecting weather patterns in mid-latitudes, and these linkages differ fundamentally from tropics/jet-stream interactions through the transfer of wave energy. In this study, new metrics and evidence are presented that suggest disproportionate Arctic warming-and resulting weakening of the poleward temperature gradient-is causing the Northern Hemisphere circulation to assume a more meridional character (i.e. wavier), although not uniformly in space or by season, and that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently. Further analysis based on self-organizing maps supports this finding. These changes in circulation are expected to lead to persistent weather patterns that are known to cause extreme weather events. As emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated, therefore, the continued amplification of Arctic warming should favour an increased occurrence of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions.},

In the model, sea ice is represented as an assemblage of objects of two types: disk-shaped "grains" and semi-elastic bonds connecting them. Grains move on the sea surface under the influence of forces from the atmosphere and the ocean, as well as interactions with surrounding grains through direct contact (Hertzian contact mechanics) and/or through bonds. The model has an experimental option of taking into account quasi-three-dimensional effects related to the space- and time-varying curvature of the sea surface, thus enabling simulation of ice breaking due to stresses resulting from bending moments associated with surface waves. Examples of the model's application to simple sea ice deformation and breaking problems are presented, with an analysis of the influence of the basic model parameters ("microscopic" properties of grains and bonds) on the large-scale response of the modeled material. The model is written as a toolbox suitable for usage with the open-source numerical library LIGGGHTS.

abstract = {[ 1] The ice pack covering northern seas is composed of a mixture of thick ridged and rafted ice, undeformed ice, and open water. Ice motions determined from satellite remote sensing data show that deformation of the pack takes place along the boundary of large floes. Eulerian continuum sea ice models can simulate this behavior to a degree by capturing the localization of gridded ice strength in some average sense. However, using a discontinuous Lagrangian approach that explicitly models ice floes and the interactions between them, it is possible to simulate both the fracture process that creates floe boundaries and the continued deformation along those floe boundaries. We have developed a granular model of the central Arctic ice pack that consists of thousands of individual grains that can freeze together, fracture apart, and interact through ridging. Accelerations produced by passing weather patterns and sustained quasi-steady deformation cause the model pack to fracture apart into floes composed of one or more grains. When the ice pack is nonuniformly accelerating due to passage of a weather pattern, simulations show that the factors that influence the size of the floes are the tensile strength of the joints between grains, the gradient of the wind field, and the average size of the individual grains. During sustained deformation the pack continues to deform along existing floe boundaries while stresses build and further fracture takes place. In quiet areas of the basin, fractures refreeze. To explore the fracture process during sustained deformation, we run 24-hour basin scale simulations at resolutions from 2.8 km to 14 km. At the end of each simulation we construct a distribution of floe areas. The cumulative distribution of floes at the large end of the distribution is approximately the same at each resolution. As we increase the resolution from 14 km to 2.8 km, the damage zones between large floes become more localized. A log-log plot of the cumulative floe size distributions obtained from the simulations appears linear over several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Satellites and several specially equipped scientific aircraft provide basin-wide altimetric measurements of sea ice freeboard, from which sea ice thickness can be estimated. Up to now, few methods have been developed to use these measurements to quantitatively assess the skill of predictive models of sea ice for the Arctic. This thesis addresses this problem, using measured freeboard from ICESat and Operation IceBridge (OIB). Output from the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) is used to demonstrate applicability of both variance- and correlation-weighted skill scores of freeboard that quantify model skill and take measurement error into account. The techniques are demonstrated using two different RASM configurations, one using Elastic-Viscous- Plastic (EVP) ice mechanics, the other using the Elastic-Anisotropic-Plastic (EAP) rheology, both simulated for 2004 and 2007, during which ICESat was in operation. RASM variance skill scores ranged from 0.712 to 0.824 and correlation skill scores were between 0.319 and 0.511. The skill scores were calculated for monthly periods and require little adaption to be applicable for monthly to decadal Navy forecasts of the Arctic. This will help improve sea ice prediction by quantifying model limitations and thus maximize the usefulness of ICESat-2 freeboard measurements after that satellite is launched next year.},

This paper demonstrates that these failure zones may be modeled with a viscous–plastic sea ice model, using an isotropic rheology. If the ice is assumed to be heterogeneous at the grid scale, and allowed to weaken in time, intersecting failure zones propagate across the region. The direction of failure propagation depends upon the stress applied to the ice (wind stress and boundary conditions) and the rheological model describing plastic failure of the ice. The spacing between failure zones is controlled by the magnitude of the wind stress and the distribution describing spatial variability of ice strength. Sea ice motion and deformation oscillate at close to a 12-h period throughout the Arctic and Antarctic pack ice. This oscillation is found at all spatial scales from hundreds of kilometers to the lead scale. It is shown that with an inertial embedded mo...},

abstract = {A new rheology that explicitly accounts for the subcontinuum anisotropy of the sea ice cover is implemented into the Los Alamos sea ice model. This is in contrast to all models of sea ice included in global circulation models that use an isotropic rheology. The model contains one new prognostic variable, the local structure tensor, which quantifies the degree of anisotropy of the sea ice, and two parameters that set the time scale of the evolution of this tensor. The anisotropic rheology provides a subcontinuum description of the mechanical behavior of sea ice and accounts for a continuum scale stress with large shear to compression ratio and tensile stress component. Results over the Arctic of a standalone version of the model are presented and anisotropic model sensitivity runs are compared with a reference elasto-visco-plastic simulation. Under realistic forcing sea ice quickly becomes highly anisotropic over large length scales, as is observed from satellite imagery. The influence of the new rheology on the state and dynamics of the sea ice cover is discussed. Our reference anisotropic run reveals that the new rheology leads to a substantial change of the spatial distribution of ice thickness and ice drift relative to the reference standard visco-plastic isotropic run, with ice thickness regionally increased by more than 1 m, and ice speed reduced by up to 50{\%}.},

abstract = {This thesis examines the use of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) the implementation of a Peridynamic technique on a Graphics processing unit (GPU). CUDA is a parallel computing architecture for NVIDIA GPUs. The NVIDIA GPUs are programmable through different industry standard programming languages. In this thesis the programming language “C for CUDA” is used to implement the Peridynamic technique. “C for CUDA” is similar to the programming language C with some restrictions. The software was executed on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti. The Peridynamic theory is a non local theory in continuum mechanic, with a focus on discontinuous functions as they arrive in fracture mechanics. The word “Peridynamic” is the syncrisis of the two Greek words $\pi$??$\iota$ (peri = near) and $\delta$ ´ $\upsilon$$\nu$$\alpha$µ$\eta$ (dynami = force). The principle of this theory is that particles in a continuum interact with other particles in a finite distance by exchanging forces. Outline},

Current Arctic sea ice models are Eulerian continuum models that use a plastic yield surface to characterize the constitutive behavior of the pack. An alternative is to adopt a discontinuous Lagrangian approach, based on a discrete element model and explicitly simulate individual ice parcels and the interactions between them.

abstract = {In recent decades, the Greenland ice sheet has experienced increased surface melt. However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here it is shown that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. The authors find a positive feedback between the variability in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and melt area of the summer Greenland ice sheet, which affects the Greenland ice sheet mass balance. This linkage may improve the projections of changes in the global sea level and thermohaline circulation.},

Cross-sectional profiles of these features are presented from which models and theoretical analyses were made. The expressions derived give the force required to overcome gravitational potential and friction occurring during ice-piling and ride-up. It was estimated that the distributed force required during ice-piling or ride-up was of the order of 10 to 350 kPa (about 1.5 to 50 psi). Field observations revealed that shore ice pile-up or ride-up appears to occur within a period of less than 30 minutes, at any time of year but most often in the spring and fall. Pile-up seldom occurs more than 10 m inland from the sea but ride-up frequently extends 50 m or more inland, regardless of ice thickness. While steeply sloping shores do not favor ice ride-up, sea ice has mounted the steep, 9-m-high bluff at Barrow, Alaska, destroying structures and taking lives. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {The plasticity of the Arctic ice pack depends on its granular nature, in particular on the size and distribution of areas of thin ice and open water surrounding multiyear ice floes. The paper begins with construction of a mesoscale (10-100 km) granular model in the central Arctic ice pack. The mesoscale model is based on a dynamic particle simulation in which individual multiyear ice floes and surrounding parces of first-year ice are explicitly modeled as discret, convex polygons in a two-dimensional domain. Deformation of the domain produces areas of localized failure and areas of open water. The areas of localized failure are modeled as pressure ridging events using the results of numerical experiments performed with a computer simulation of the ridging process. The paper focuses on the results of numerical experiments performed with the mesoscale model. In the experiments the model ice pack is biaxially deformed at constant strain rates. The principal strain rates are varied to create deformation states ranging from pure shear to uniform compression. The results define the shape and magnitude of the plastic yield surface, the strain rate vectors assosciated with points on the yield surface, the partition of energy dissipation between ridging and in-plane sliding, and the changes in the ice thickness distribution associated with various deformation states.},

abstract = {A discrete element model is used to study shear rupture of sea ice under convergent wind stresses. The model includes compressive, tensile, and shear rupture of viscous elastic joints connecting floes that move under the action of the wind stresses. The adopted shear rupture is governed by Coulomb's criterion. The ice pack is a 400 km long square domain consisting of 4 km size floes. In the standard case with tensile strength 10 times smaller than the compressive strength, under uniaxial compression the failure regime is mainly shear rupture with the most probable scenario corresponding to that with the minimum failure work. The orientation of cracks delineating formed aggregates is bimodal with the peaks around the angles given by the wing crack theory determining diamond-shaped blocks. The ice block (floe aggregate) size decreases as the wind stress gradient increases since the elastic strain energy grows faster leading to a higher speed of crack propagation. As the tensile strength grows, shear rupture becomes harder to attain and compressive failure becomes equally important leading to elongation of blocks perpendicular to the compression direction and the blocks grow larger. In the standard case, as the wind stress confinement ratio increases the failure mode changes at a confinement ratio within 0.2-0.4, which corresponds to the analytical critical confinement ratio of 0.32. Below this value, the cracks are bimodal delineating diamond shape aggregates, while above this value failure becomes isotropic and is determined by small-scale stress anomalies due to irregularities in floe shape.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a new non-ordinary state-based peridynamic method to solve transient dynamic solid mechanics problems. This new peridynamic method has advantages over the previously developed bond-based and ordinary state-based peridynamic methods in that its bonds are not restricted to central forces, nor is it restricted to a Poisson's ratio of 1/4 as with the bond-based method. First, we obtain non-local nodal deformation gradients that are used to define nodal strain tensors. The deformation gradient tensors are used with the nodal strain tensors to obtain rate of deformation tensors in the deformed configuration. The polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensors are then used to obtain the nodal rotation tensors which are used to rotate the rate of deformation tensors and previous Cauchy stress tensors into an unrotated configuration. These are then used with conventional Cauchy stress constitutive models in the unrotated state where the unrotated Cauchy stress rate is objective. We then obtain the unrotated Cauchy nodal stress tensors and rotate them back into the deformed configuration where they are used to define the forces in the nodal connecting bonds. As a first example we quasi-statically stretch a bar, hold it, and then rotate it ninety degrees to illustrate the methods finite rotation capabilities. Next, we verify our new method by comparing small strain results from a bar fixed at one end and subjected to an initial velocity gradient with results obtained from the corresponding one-dimensional small strain analytical solution. As a last example, we show the fracture capabilities of the method using both a notched and un-notched bar. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

In this paper, hitherto unexplored analogies between this type of ice cover and two-dimensional granular gases are used to formulate a model of ice dynamics at the floe level. The model consists of: (i) momentum equations for floe motion between collisions, formulated in the form of a Stokes-flow problem, with floe-size dependent time constant and equilibrium velocity, and (ii) hard-disk collision model. The numerical algorithm developed is suitable for simulating particle-laden flow of N disk-shaped floes with arbitrary size distribution. The model is applied to study clustering phenomena in sea ice with power-law floe-size distribution. In particular, the influence of the average ice concentration barA on the formation and characteristics of clusters is analyzed in detail. The results show the existence of two regimes, at low and high ice concentration, differing in terms of the exponents of the cluster-size distribution and of the size of the largest cluster.},

The self-organizing map (SOM) training algorithm was used to identify 12 wind patterns that represent the range of winter [November-March (NDJFM)] wind regimes identified in the fully coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) during 1990-2010. For all wind patterns, the ocean loses buoyancy, primarily through the turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes; haline contributions to buoyancy change were found to be insignificant compared to the thermal contributions. Patterns with westerly winds at the Cape Farewell area had the largest buoyancy loss over the Irminger and Labrador Seas due to large turbulent fluxes from strong winds and the advection of anomalously cold, dry air over the warmer ocean. Similar to observations, RASM simulated typical ocean mixed layer depths (MLD) of approximately 400 m throughout the Irminger basin, with individual years experiencing MLDs of 800 m or greater. The ocean mixed layer deepens over most of the Irminger Sea following wind events with northerly flow, and the deepening is greater for patterns of longer duration. Seasonal deepest MLD is strongly and positively correlated to the frequency of westerly tip jets with northerly flow.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}At medium ice concentrations, sea ice consists of separate floes of different sizes interacting with each other through inelastic collisions, in a way similar to two-dimensional polydisperse granular gases. The dynamics of this type of ice cover is poorly understood. In this paper, a molecular-dynamics sea-ice model based on simplified momentum equations and a hard-disk collision model is used to analyze processes of cluster formation in sea-ice floes. The clusters, formed due to size-dependent equilibrium velocities of floes under a given forcing, have statistical properties dependent on the average ice concentration and on the parameters of the floe-size distribution. In particular, in terms of the size of the largest cluster in the system, two regimes are observed: one at low and one at high ice concentration. At high ice concentration, the dominating cluster spans the entire model domain and contains the majority of floes. The exponent of the cluster-size distribution increases with increasing exponent of the floe-size distribution. The results are discussed from the point of view of the collisional contribution to the internal stress in the ice, as well as from the role of clustering in the floe-formation processes. Thus, they may contribute to the formulation of more reliable sea-ice rheology models valid at medium ice concentrations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The sea ice pressure ridigng process is modeled using a two-dimensional particle simulation technique. In this model, blocks are broken from an intact sheet of relatively thin lead ice driven against a thick, multiyear floe at a constant speed. The blocks of ice rubble accumulate to form the ridge sail and keel. The energy consumed in ridge growth, including dissipation, is explicitly calculated. A series of numerical experiments are performed to establish the dependence of the energetics on the thickness of the ice sheet and the friction between blocks. The results suggest that the total energy required to create a pressure ridge is an order of magnitude greater than the potential energy in the ridge structure. A typical sea ice cover in the polar regions contains a variety of ice thickness that evolve in response to both dynamic and thermodynamic forcing. The variable thickness of the ice cover is created by deformation, which simultaneously causes formation of thick ice through ridge building and thin ice through lead creation. Since the energy expended in deformation is largely determined by the ridging process, an understanding of the energetics of pressure ridging is critical in the determination of ice strength on a geophysical scale.},

abstract = {The fracture and fragmentation processes of ice are reviewed using fractal concepts. Numerous evidences for the scale invariance of fracture and fragmentation patterns in ice are given, including fracture networks at small (laboratory) and large (geophysical) scales, the distribution of fragment sizes in crushed ice or the distribution of sea ice floe sizes, or self-affine fracture surfaces. These observations strongly argue for the scale invariance of fracture and fragmentation processes in ice. This implies that the fracture mechanisms and the physical parameters revealed at the laboratory scale are still relevant at large scale. However, apparent scale effects can be observed for some parameters if the fractal geometry is ignored or neglected. Scale invariance also implies that the homogenization procedures used in the damage mechanics of ice have to be taken with caution. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For sufficiently homogeneous and differentiable displacements, the model is shown to be equivalent to Eringen's nonlocal elasticity. As the peridynamic horizon approaches 0, it reduces to the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam equations. Simple test cases demonstrate the model's performance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Coulombic faulting, a concept formulated more than two centuries ago, still remains pertinent in describing the brittle compressive failure of various materials, including rocks and ice. Many questions remain, however, about the physical processes underlying this macroscopic phenomenology. This paper reviews the progress made in these directions during the past few years through the study of ice and its mechanical behaviour in both the laboratory and the field. Fault triggering is associated with the formation of specific features called comb-cracks and involves frictional sliding at the micro(grain)-scale. Similar mechanisms are observed at geophysical scales within the sea ice cover. This scale-independent physics is expressed by the same Coulombic phenomenology from laboratory to geophysical scales, with a very similar internal friction coefficient (mu approximate to 0.8). On the other hand, the cohesion strongly decreases with increasing spatial scale, reflecting the role of stress concentrators on fault initiation. Strong similarities also exist between ice and other brittle materials such as rocks and minerals and between faulting of the sea ice cover and Earth's crust, arguing for the ubiquitous nature of the underlying physics.},

abstract = {Propagation of bending fracture along a floating sea ice plate, representing an elastic plate on elastic foundation, is analyzed in the sense of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), assuming the entire plate thickness to be fractured all the way to the fracture tip. The analysis focuses on the size effect. Two specific problems are solved in an idealized form: steady state propagation of thermal bending fracture and vertical penetration of an object through the plate. In both problems it is found that the nominal strength (equivalent to the {\~{}}ritical temperature difference in the first problem) decreases as (thickness)-3/8. In the thermal problem, the (73/8)-power law is exact (under the hypotheses of the analysis), while in the penetration problem it is only approximate, approached asymptotically for large sizes. This (-3/8)-power law differs from that known for two-dimensional or axisymmetric LEFM, in which the nominal strength scales as (size)-1/2; the difference is caused by the presence of a characteristic length for bending disturbance decay along the plate. An in-plane compressive force makes the size effect stronger than (thickness)-3/8, and an in-plane tensile force makes it weaker. Creep and propagation rate effects are approximately taken into account in the thermal problem, and so is the effect of in-plane forces on bending. A numerical example shows that the temperature changes occurring in the Arctic suffice, according to the present theory, to produce bending fractures. Such fractures might serve to initiate the formation of leads of open water, pressure ridges and rafting.},

abstract = {The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission used laser altimetry measurements to determine changes in elevations of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as sea ice thickness distribution. These measurements have provided important information on the response of the cryopshere (Earth's frozen surfaces) to changes in atmosphere and ocean condition. ICESat operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided repeat altimetry measurements not only to the cryosphere scientific community but also to the ocean, terrestrial and atmospheric scientific communities. The conclusive assessment of significant ongoing rapid changes in the Earth's ice cover, in part supported by ICESat observations, has strengthened the need for sustained, high accuracy, repeat observations similar to what was provided by the ICESat mission. Following recommendations from the National Research Council for an ICESat follow-on mission, the ICESat-2 mission is now under development for planned launch in 2018. The primary scientific aims of the ICESat-2 mission are to continue measurements of sea ice freeboard and ice sheet elevation to determine their changes at scales from outlet glaciers to the entire ice sheet, and from 10s of meters to the entire polar oceans for sea ice freeboard. ICESat carried a single beam profiling laser altimeter that produced {\~{}} 70 m diameter footprints on the surface of the Earth at {\~{}} 150 m along-track intervals. In contrast, ICESat-2 will operate with three pairs of beams, each pair separated by about 3 km cross-track with a pair spacing of 90 m. Each of the beams will have a nominal 17 m diameter footprint with an along-track sampling interval of 0.7 m. The differences in the ICESat-2 measurement concept are a result of overcoming some limitations associated with the approach used in the ICESat mission. The beam pair configuration of ICESat-2 allows for the determination of local cross-track slope, a significant factor in measuring elevation change for the outlet glaciers surrounding the Greenland and Antarctica coasts. The multiple beam pairs also provide improved spatial coverage. The dense spatial sampling eliminates along-track measurement gaps, and the small footprint diameter is especially useful for sea surface height measurements in the often narrow leads needed for sea ice freeboard and ice thickness retrievals. The ICESat-2 instrumentation concept uses a low energy 532 nm (green) laser in conjunction with single-photon sensitive detectors to measure range. Combining ICESat-2 data with altimetry data collected since the start of the ICESat mission in 2003, such as Operation IceBridge and ESA's CryoSat-2, will yield a 15 + year record of changes in ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness. ICESat-2 will also provide information of mountain glacier and ice cap elevations changes, land and vegetation heights, inland water elevations, sea surface heights, and cloud layering and optical thickness.},

@article{Hunke1997,
abstract = {The standard model for sea ice dynamics treats the ice pack as a visco–plastic material that flows plastically under typical stress conditions but behaves as a linear viscous fluid where strain rates are small and the ice becomes nearly rigid. Because of large viscosities in these regions, implicit numerical methods are necessary for time steps larger than a few seconds. Current solution methods for these equations use iterative relaxation methods, which are time consuming, scale poorly with mesh resolution, and are not well adapted to parallel computation. To remedy this, the authors developed and tested two separate methods. First, by demonstrating that the viscous–plastic rheology can be represented by a symmetric, negative definite matrix operator, the much faster and better behaved preconditioned conjugate gradient method was implemented. Second, realizing that only the response of the ice on timescales associated with wind forcing need be accurately resolved, the model was modified so that it reduces to the viscous–plastic model at these timescales, whereas at shorter timescales the adjustment process takes place by a numerically more efficient elastic wave mechanism. This modification leads to a fully explicit numerical scheme that further improves the model's computational efficiency and is a great advantage for implementations on parallel machines. Furthermore, it is observed that the standard viscous–plastic model has poor dynamic response to forcing on a daily timescale, given the standard time step (1 day) used by the ice modeling community. In contrast, the explicit discretization of the elastic wave mechanism allows the elastic–viscous–plastic model to capture the ice response to variations in the imposed stress more accurately. Thus, the elastic–viscous–plastic model provides more accurate results for shorter timescales associated with physical forcing, reproduces viscous–plastic model behavior on longer timescales, and is computationally more efficient overall.},

The model is implemented with a finite element method and a Lagrangian advection scheme. Simulations of 10 days are performed over the Arctic at a resolution of 7km. The model, which has only a few parameters, generates discontinuous sea ice velocity fields and strongly localized deformation features that occupy a few percent of the total sea ice cover area but accommodate most of the deformation.

abstract = {We introduce an energy-conserving sea ice model for climate study that accounts for the effect of internal brine-pocket melting on surface ablation. Sea ice models that parameterize latent heat storage in brine pockets often fail to reduce the energy required for surface ablation in proportion to the internal melting that has already occurred. These models do not conserve energy during the summer melt season. Compared with our energy-conserving model, a nonconserving model underestimates top-surface ablation of multiyear ice by 12–22{\%} and overestimates the equilibrium ice thickness by 50–124 cm. In addition, a nonconserving model is less sensitive to perturbative forcing than our energy-conserving model is: The equilibrium thickness changes 22–44{\%} less owing to surface albedo perturbations and 13–31{\%} less owing to downward longwave radiation perturbations. The smaller differences are associated with a model that has a time-independent, vertically varying salinity profile, and the larger differences are associated with a model that assumes the ice is isosaline with a salinity of 3.2‰. Simulations with a vertically varying salinity profile have low salinity at the top surface compared to isosaline cases, which leads to reduced heat conduction, less internal brine-pocket melting, and more surface ablation.},

The modulus state, which is used to form the Jacobian matrix in Newton-Raphson algorithms, is presented. The model is shown to satisfy the 2nd law of thermodynamics and is applicable to problems in solid continuum mechanics where fracture and rate effects are important; it inherits all the advantages for modeling fracture associated with peridynamics.

abstract = {Predicting sea ice motion in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas is important for facilitating marine commercial operations and rescue activities when sea ice is present. This project developed an open-source computational framework and software library for discrete element modeling of sea ice mechanics (“Siku”). Siku uses a global (spherical) reference frame, employing regional ice sheet coverage and local (planar) reference frames, to calculate interactions between ice elements. It incorporates reanalysis surface winds from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) as driving forces, but it can also use and combine other sources for wind and current data. Siku modeling allows ice to fail in tension and, when provided appropriate along-shore boundary conditions, can reproduce the locations where leads have been observed to form along the coast. The spacing of large-scale leads originating at the coast can be simulated by defining the along-shore boundary as the minimum observed landfast ice edge in any month. Siku output products are independent of the size of discrete element method (DEM) elements (resolution independence). Comparison of Siku simulations with satellite images indicated good correspondence of the locations and patterns of ice openings in the leads that Siku predicted with the satellite observations for the same wind field. Siku simulations indicated that initiation of arching leads occurs at promontories along the coastline and landfast ice edge and that the pattern of leads is a strong function of wind direction and confinement along the shore boundary. These arches occur in tensile failure, and their initiation is well represented with a linear elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) representation of contacts between ice elements. Future improvement to Siku will include fine-tuning implementation of shear failure criteria to reproduce shear failure at Point Barrow and the Beaufort Sea shore lead. v},

As an aid to the modeling of such materials, a new framework for the basic equations of continuum mechanics, called the 'peridynamic' formulation, is proposed. The propagation of linear stress waves in the new theory is discussed, and wave dispersion relations are derived. Material stability and its connection with wave propagation is investigated. It is demonstrated by an example that the reformulated approach permits the solution of fracture problems using the same equations either on or off the crack surface or crack tip. This is an advantage for modeling problems in which the location of a crack is not known in advance. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We perform global simulations of the Los Alamos sea-ice model, CICE, with a new thermody- namics component that has a fully prognostic, variable bulk salinity vertical profile based on mushy layer physics. The processes of gravity drainage, melt-water flushing and snow-ice formation are parameterized to allow the bulk salinity to evolve with time. We analyze the seasonal and spatial variation of sea-ice bulk salinity, area, volume and thickness and compare these quantities to simulations using the previous thermo- dynamic component. Adjusting one of the gravity drainage parameters, we find good agreement between simulation results and fieldwork ice-core observations of sea-ice bulk salinity. As expected, bulk salinity is highest during periods of ice growth and lowest after periods of ice melt. In the northern hemisphere the new thermodynamics component produces thicker ice than the previous thermodynamics component. Of the nine major differences between the two models, differences in how salinities are calculated and how melt-pond flushing is parameterized are the principal causes of this thickness difference. Thickness differen- ces are smaller in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere since a greater fraction of ice melts, and differences cannot accumulate year-on-year. Model differences in how ice thickness changes and snow-ice formation are calculated are the most important causes of the different thickness between the two thermodynamic components in the southern hemisphere. The melt-pond area and volume are found to be highly sensitive to a parameter choice controlling drainage through macroscopic holes in the ice, in both hemispheres.},

This report addresses both of these issues and thus establishes the first ordinary, state-based peridynamics plasticity model. Integration of the flow rule follows along the lines of the classical theories of rate independent J2 plasticity [6]. It uses elastic force state relations, an additive decomposition of the deformation state, an elastic force state domain, a flow rule, loading/un-loading con- ditions, and a consistency condition. Just as in local theories of plasticity (LTP), state variables are required. It is shown that the resulting constitutive model does not vio- late the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The report also develops a useful non-local yield criterion that depends upon the yield stress and horizon for the material. The modulus state for both the ordinary elastic material [3] and aforementioned plasticity model is also developed and presented.},

The first part of the study investigated particle discharge under gravity without vibration to determine the critical orifice size (Bc) to just sustain flow as a function of particle shape. It is shown that polygonal-shaped particles need a larger orifice than circular particles. It is also shown that Bcdecreases as the number of particle vertices increases. Addition of circular particles promotes flow of polygons in a linear manner. The second part of the study showed that vibration could enhance flow, effectively reducing Bc. The model demonstrated the importance of vibrator location (height), consistent with previous continuum model results, and vibration amplitude in enhancing flow. {\textcopyright} 2008 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

In current climate models form drag is only accounted for by tuning the air–ice and ice–ocean drag coefficients, that is, by effectively altering the roughness length in a surface drag parameterization. The existing approach of the skin drag parameter tuning is poorly constrained by observations and fails to describe correctly the physics associated with the air–ice and ocean–ice drag. Here, the authors combine recent theoretical developments to deduce the total neutral form drag coefficients from properties of the ice cover such as ice concentration, vertical extent and area of the ridges, freeboard and floe draft, and the size of floes and melt ponds. The drag coefficients are incorporated into the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) and show the influence of the new drag parameterization on the motion and state of the ice cover...},

abstract = {Hamilton's principle of stationary action lies at the foundation of theoretical physics and is applied in many other disciplines from pure mathematics to economics. Despite its utility, Hamilton's principle has a subtle pitfall that often goes unnoticed in physics: it is formulated as a boundary value problem in time but is used to derive equations of motion that are solved with initial data. This subtlety can have undesirable effects. I present a formulation of Hamilton's principle that is compatible with initial value problems. Remarkably, this leads to a natural formulation for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems, thereby filling a long-standing gap in classical mechanics. Thus dissipative effects, for example, can be studied with new tools that may have application in a variety of disciplines. The new formalism is demonstrated by two examples of non-conservative systems: an object moving in a fluid with viscous drag forces and a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment.},

In this model, the contact forces among ice particles are calculated using a viscous-elastic-plastic model, while the maximum shear forces are described with the Mohr-Coulomb friction law. With this modified DEM, the ice flow dynamics is simulated under the drags of wind and current in a channel of various widths. The thicknesses, concentrations and velocities of ice particles are obtained, and then reasonable dynamic process is analyzed. The sea ice dynamic process is also simulated in a vortex wind field.

abstract = {We further develop a recently introduced variational principle of stationary action for problems in nonconservative classical mechanics and extend it to classical field theories. The variational calculus used is consistent with an initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible processes, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a nonconservative action {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}, which is a functional of a doubled set of degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a potential {\$}K{\$} which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open system interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out or coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer conserved when {\$}K{\$} is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a physical system are derived solely from {\$}K{\$}. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational principle. We present the nonconservative action for a Navier-Stokes fluid including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well as an action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can be easily generalized to more realistic rheological models. We show that the nonconservative action can be derived as the classical limit of a more complete quantum theory.},

abstract = {A numerical model for the simulation of sea ice circulation and thickness over a seasonal cycle is presented. This model is used to investigate the effects of ice dynamics on Arctic ice thickness and air-sea heat flux characteristics by carrying out several numerical simulations over the entire Arctic Ocean region. The essential idea in the model is to couple the dynamics to the ice thickness characteristics by allowing the ice interaction to become stronger as the ice becomes thicker and/or contains a lower areas percentage of thin ice. The dynamics in turn causes high oceanic heat losses in regions of ice divergence and reduced heat losses in regions of convergence. TO model these effects consistently the ice is considered to interact in a plastic manner with the plastic strength chosen to depend on the ice thickness and concentration. The thickness and concentration, in turn, evolve according to continuity equations which include changes in ice mass and percent of open water due to advection, ice deformation and thermodynamic effects. For the standard experiment an integration of eight years in length is performed at one day timesteps and 125 km resolution in order to obtain a cyclic equilibrium. A zero ice strength condition is used at the Greenland-Spitsbergen passage to allow natural outflow or inflow. Several other shorter experiments, including a case without open water effects, are also run for comparison. Input fields consist of observed time varying geostrophic winds over a one year period, fixed geostrophic ocean currents, and geographically invariant ice growth rates dependent on ice thickness and season. Many of the observed features of the circulation and thickness of the Arctic ice cover are reproduced by the model. The average annual drift shows the classic anticyclonic ice flow in the Beaufort Sea together with a transpolar drift of ice from the Siberian coast toward the Greenland Sea. In addition, the nonlinear plastic rheology allows the formation of a shear zone (velocity discontinuity) from time to time off the North Slope of Alaska. The average rate of ice export out of the basin is ∼0.1 Sv in reasonable agreement with observational estimates. Geographical ice thickness contours show ice in excess of 6 m along the Canadian Archipelago with thicknesses decreasing to 2 m near the Siberian coast. The form of these contours is in good agreement with that estimated from submarine sonar data and aerial ridge surveys. In summer a low compactness region of up to 50{\%} open water builds up off the Alaskan and Siberian coasts, in general agreement with satellite-derived ice concentration charts. Further from shore, smaller, but still significant, amounts (∼10{\%}) of open water also form in summer. An important, less verifiable characteristic is that the annual net ice production is dominated by the North Slope and Siberian nearshore regions where, on the average, offshore advection creates open water and thinner ice. Overall the simulation results suggest that lateral heat transport due to ice motion is of the same order of magnitude as vertical air-sea heat fluxes.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional particle simulation model of the sea-ice ridging process is developed. In this model, ridges are formed from a floating layer of rubble compressed between converging multiyear floes. The energy consumed in ridge growth, including dissipation, is explicitly calculated. A series of experiments are performed to establish the dependence of the energy consumed in ridging on the velocity of the multiyear floes and on the shape, the friction coefficient, and the inelasticity of the rubble blocks. The experiments show that shape and friction between ice blocks are the most significant factors in determining the energy required to ridge ice. In large-scale sea ice modeling, using a variable thickness approach, it is convenient to parameterize total ridging work in terms of the increase of potential energy. The results of the ridging simulations with block-shaped rubble suggests that the total ridging work may be 4-5 times the increase in potential energy. At the same time, an analytical model of the ridging process is developed from classical Mohr-Coulomb-Rankine theory for a cohesionless granular material. The predictions of this model, using values of porosity and the passive pressure coefficient derive from the ridge simulations, are in fair agreement with the numerical experiments. However, several violations of the basic assumptions underlying the Mohr-Coulomb-Rankine model are noted in the ridge simulations. {\textcopyright}1991 American Geophysical Union},

On the basis of the results of simulations performed with the model, the ridging process can be divided into four distinct stages. The first stage begins with an intact sheet of lead ice impacting a floe and ends when the sail reaches its maximum height. In the second stage the ridge keel deepens and widens. The stage ends when the maximum keel draft is reached. In the third stage the direction of growth is leadward creating a rubble field of more or less uniform thickness. The third stage ends when the supply of thin ice is exhausted. In the fourth stage the rubble field is compressed between converging floes. The results of simulations establish the dependence of ridging energetics in the first and second stages on the thickness of the ice sheet and the amount of ice pushed into the ridge. The average profiles of the simulated ridges delineate the growth process in the first, second, and third stages. The energetics and profiles of the fourth stage were described by Hopkins et al. [1991]. Lead ice extents of up to 1300 m are pushed into ridges to determine maximum sail heights, keel drafts, and ridging forces.},

Determination of keel porosity from drillholes is time-intensive and only yields limited information because of their limited lateral extent. Since the porosity within a keel equals its liquid water content, surface-nuclear magnetic resonance (surface-NMR) methods can be used to estimate porosity within such features. Surface-NMR tomography measurements were made in April 2011 using seven surface coil positions across a first-year pressure ridge on landfast sea ice near Barrow, Alaska, USA. The inversion results indicate water contents of 307{\%} and 4010{\%} in the ridge's shallow and deep parts, respectively. These values are much higher than those obtained from drillholes, which are 10{\%} and 27{\%}, respectively. In contrast to drilling, surface-NMR tomography yields average porosity values for the entire subsurface volume. However, the inversion process is sensitive to the electrical conductivity distribution; uncertain conductivity estimates limit the reliability of the inverted water contents. Nevertheless, the results suggest that ridge porosities obtained from invasive measurements such as drilling may lead to substantially overestimated sea-ice volume.},

abstract = {A method for estimating ship's resistance caused by sea ice ridge keels is revised and used as a part of a method for predicting performance of ships in ridged ice conditions. The resistance method is based on a continuum plasticity model of ridge rubble and is simple to compute. The performance prediction method combines deterministic simulations of ship motion with probabilistic modelling of ridged ice fields. Performance estimates given by the model are distribution of attainable mean speeds for given ice conditions and probability of the ship being able to operate independently. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to gain insight into the model and identify possible problematic parameters. The sensitivity analysis covered both the ice conditions and modelling assumptions. Two data-sets were used to test the simulation method. One set included the depth profile of sea ice, machinery data and the speed of a ship operating in ridged ice. The resistance method was able to predict the mean speed over 3km well. The second data-set consisted of a history of ship's speeds and positions from AIS data and ice conditions estimated by a numerical ice model HELMI, developed in the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Observed mean speeds were mostly well within the distributions of mean speeds simulated by the transit simulation model. Predictions of independent operation were also promising.},

abstract = {Fracturing of freshwater granular ice up to failure under uniaxial compression creep was investigated from series of interrupted creep tests and from a multifractal analysis of the corresponding fracture patterns. At the early stages of damage corresponding to primary and secondary creep, the fracturing process is dominated by the nucleation of microcracks from stress concentrations within the material (unlike rocks, artificial freshwater ice does not contains starter flaws). Because of the crack nucleation mechanisms, the microstructure of the material (e.g., the nonfractal grain size distribution) strongly influences the organization of fracturing which is therefore nonfractal. As fracturing proceeds during tertiary creep, a hierarchical (fractal) organization of the fracturing emerges progressively over a wider scale range. At failure, this fractal organization is fully developed without detectable lower or upper bound, and the role of the initial microstructure has completely disappeared. Similarly, cracks are preferentially oriented along the compression axis at the early stages of damage, but this anisotropy vanishes as failure is approached. The simultaneity between the onset of tertiary creep and the emergence of fractal organization suggests that the acceleration of the deformation during tertiary creep is due to the cataclasis of a material which becomes granular. An important consequence of the fractal organization of fracturing is that homogenization procedures, as well as damage mechanics, developed to study the behavior of damaged materials, cannot be used to describe tertiary creep and failure.

abstract = {Subsea sonars moored in the Beaufort Sea acquired a spatial section of draft across 941 km of sea ice during the winter of 1991-1992. These observations document the development of seasonal sea ice from an open sea surface in October to an average accumulation exceeding 2.5 m draft by early April. Initially, level ice occupied 85{\%} of the profile, but continued ridging reduced this fraction to 50{\%} in late winter. Three modes of level ice were tracked: that of seasonal ice whose growth was initiated at freeze-up, and two others created during openings of the ice field in January and in March. The growth of these modes can be closely matched by calculations based on a slab model of ice formation forced using surface meteorological data. Initially, ridge keels were small and widely spaced. By midwinter an exponential dependence of keel frequency on draft was obvious (e-folding scale, 2.16 m), and the frequency and mean draft of keels had stabilized. The maximum keel draft was a modest 17.4 m. The low incidence of deep keels at all times is a statistically significant departure from the exponential dependence valid at lesser drafts. The truncation point of the exponential relation Is related to the draft of the thinnest level ice present. In late winter the formation of deeper keels from thick first-year ice was apparently precluded by the presence of younger, thinner ice, which limited the force available for ridge building. Through calculation of the seaward transport of ice over the sonars, the total production of ice in the coastal flaw lead during 1991-1992 was determined to be about 60{\%} of earlier indirect estimates. In general, the observations revealed winter ice conditions significantly less severe than those found on the periphery of the polar pack only a few tens of kilometers to the north, but more so than conditions in a marginal first-year ice zone at the same latitude in Davis Strait.},

The laser was a PRAM III system with a measurement frequency of 1-4 kHz, a footprint of approximately 20 cm at a flight elevation of 100 m and a single-shot vertical resolution of 12.5 cm. The laser profiles were calibrated to remove aircraft motion and averaged to 1-m intervals which combined to produce an elevation accuracy of 1.8 cm. A total of 51 profiles with varying lengths from 6 to 24 km, in all 662 km, are analyzed. The data were stratified into 5 groups representing different ice fields. The standard deviation of the surface elevations ranged from 7 to 14 cm. The spectrum of surface roughness displayed a red noise form (slope about -1.5) through the wave-lengths 4 to 100 m. Ice ridges were identified using the Rayleigh criterion with a cutoff height of 40 cm. The mean ridge height ranged from 52 to 59 cm, the standard deviation 12 to 20 cm, and the maximum ridge height sampled was 197 cm. The number of ridges was 1.4 to 9.5 km{\_}, for 4 of the groups and up to 17.4 km - 1 in one group representing an intense shear zone. Ridge heights were exponentially distributed whereas the log-normal distribution provided the best fit for the ridge spacings. Mean ridge height and ridge density were not strongly correlated. The amount of ridged ice was estimated to account for 1 to 18 cm of equivalent ice thickness while based on a crude extrapolation method rubble fields summed up to 2-10 cm. Deformed ice constituted 15-40 {\%} of the total ice volume.},

abstract = {In viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice models, small deformations are approximated by irreversible viscous deformations, introducing a nonphysical energy sink. As the spatial resolution and the degree of numerical convergence of the models increase, linear kinematic features (LKFs) are better resolved and more states of stress lie in the viscous regime. Energy dissipation in this nonphysical viscous regime therefore increases. We derive a complete kinetic energy (KE) balance for sea ice, including plastic and viscous energy sinks to study energy dissipation. The main KE balance is between the energy input by the wind and the dissipation by the water drag and the internal stresses (dissipating 87{\%} and 13{\%} of the energy input on an annual average). The internal stress term is mostly important in winter when ice-ice interactions are dominant. The energy input that is not dissipated locally is redistributed laterally by the internal stresses into regions of dissipation by small-scale deformations (LKFs). Of the 13{\%} dissipated annually by the internal stress term, 93{\%} is dissipated in plastic friction along LKFs (14{\%} in ridging, 79{\%} in shearing) and 7{\%} is stored as potential energy in ridges. For all time and spatial scales tested, the frictional viscous dissipation is negligible in the KE balance. This conclusion remains valid regardless of the degree of numerical convergence of the simulations. Overall, the results confirm the applicability, from an energetical point of view, of the VP approximation.},

To this end, different model configurations with and without an ITD were tuned by minimizing the weighted mean error between the simulated and observed sea ice concentration, thickness, and drift speed with an semiautomatic parameter optimization routine. The standard ITD and ice strength parameterization lead to larger errors when compared to the simple single-category model with an ice strength parameterization based on the mean ice thickness. Interestingly, the simpler ice strength formulation, which depends linearly on the mean ice thickness, also reduces the model-observation error when using an ITD. For the ice strength parameterization that makes use of the ITD, the effective ice strength depends strongly on the number of thickness categories, so that introducing more categories can lead to overall thicker ice that is more easily deformed.},

abstract = {The Arctic sea ice cover is thinning and retreating, causing changes in surface roughness that in turn modify the momentum flux from the atmosphere through the ice into the ocean. New model simu- lations comprising variable sea ice drag coefficients for both the air and water interface demonstrate that the heterogeneity in sea ice surface roughness significantly impacts the spatial distribution and trends of ocean surface stress during the last decades. Simulations with constant sea ice drag coefficients as used in most climate models show an increase in annual mean ocean surface stress (0.003 N/m2 per decade, 4.6{\%}) due to the reduction of ice thickness leading to a weakening of the ice and accelerated ice drift. In contrast, with variable drag coefficients our simulations show annual mean ocean surface stress is declining at a rate of 20.002 N/m2 per decade (3.1{\%}) over the period 1980–2013 because of a significant reduction in surface roughness associated with an increasingly thinner and younger sea ice cover. The effectiveness of sea ice in transferring momentum does not only depend on its resistive strength against the wind forcing but is also set by its top and bottom surface roughness varying with ice types and ice conditions. This reveals the need to account for sea ice surface roughness variations in climate simulations in order to correctly represent the implications of sea ice loss under global warming.},
